Here you create the Visual Studio solution with its projects. You also put the nuget config file here (see an example in the doc folder), together with other files that must reside in the root folder for the solution, e.g. an .editorconfig file (see an example in the doc folder). 

Remember that if you intend to use a nuget config file, and/or a .editorconfig file, they should be created before the solution is created in Visual Studio.
